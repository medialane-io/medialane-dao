# Community Guidelines

Welcome to Medialane, a decentralized protocol for creators and communities. These guidelines are designed to foster a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment for all participants.

## 1. Introduction

Medialane is not a product—it’s infrastructure for humanity:

* Free to use, fork, and build on.
* Open-source and auditable.
* Designed for global accessibility.
* Committed to ethical innovation and decentralization.

## 2. Purpose & Ethos

Medialane is more than a protocol—it’s a movement to empower creators through decentralized intellectual property. These guidelines are designed to:

* Foster a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment.
* Encourage open-source innovation and DAO participation.
* Protect the integrity of creative works and governance processes.
* Align community behavior with the values of sovereignty, transparency, and equity.

## 3. Core Principles

We uphold the following foundational values:

* **Creator Sovereignty:** Every contributor retains full control over their work and identity.
* **Decentralized Integrity:** Actions are made transparently, without centralized gatekeepers.
* **Open Collaboration:** Contributions are welcomed from all skill levels and backgrounds.
* **Respectful Dialogue:** Disagreement is welcome; disrespect is not.
* **Public Good Orientation:** Medialane is a protocol for collective benefit, not private gain.

## 4. Code of Conduct

All participants agree to:

* Engage with empathy, professionalism, and integrity.
* Avoid harassment, hate speech, or discriminatory behavior.
* Refrain from spamming, trolling, or disruptive conduct.
* Respect licensing terms and intellectual property rights.
* Use pseudonymous identities responsibly and ethically.
* Violations may result in moderation actions or DAO-led proposals for restriction.

## 5. Contributor Journey

Medialane welcomes contributions across multiple domains:

### Creators
* Tokenize and license original works.

### Developers
* Build smart contracts, dApps, and services.

### Curators
* Organize, promote, and contextualize IP assets.

### Governors
* Propose and vote on upgrades and policies.

## 6. Contributor Standards

To maintain quality and trust:

* Follow Medialane’s documentation and licensing protocols.
* Submit code with clear commit history and comments.
* Attribute third-party assets and respect open-source licenses.
* Engage in governance with thoughtful proposals and votes.
* Disclose conflicts of interest when relevant to DAO decisions.

## 7. Communication Channels

We encourage open dialogue across platforms:

* **Discord / Telegram:** Real-time support and discussion.
* **GitHub:** For code contributions, issue tracking.
* **Social Media:** Amplify updates and creator stories.
* **Email:** For formal communications and inquiries.

## 8. Recognition & Incentives

Contributors may be rewarded through:

* DAO grants and bounties.
* Governance token allocations.
* Reputation scores or contributor badges.
* Public acknowledgment in releases and documentation.
* Token distribution/airdrops.

*All incentives are subject to DAO approval and transparent reporting.*

## 9. Moderation & Enforcement

While Medialane is permissionless, community spaces may be moderated to:

* Remove harmful or illegal content.
* Enforce these guidelines.
* Protect the integrity of governance and collaboration.
* Address spam, trolling, or disruptive behavior.
* Ensure network protection.

*Moderation actions may be appealed via DAO proposals.*

## 10. Decentralization

As Medialane evolves:

* Governance power will shift increasingly to the community.
* Contributor roles may expand through subDAOs and working groups.
* Guidelines will be updated through transparent, on-chain proposals.
