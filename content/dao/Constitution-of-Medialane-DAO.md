# Constitution of Medialane DAO
**Programmable IP for the Integrity Web**

## Preamble

We, the members of Medialane DAO, establish this Constitution to govern a decentralized autonomous organization dedicated to the development of public service technologies that empower all intelligences to register, license, and monetize intellectual property.

We operate at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence, expanding digital sovereignty, privacy, and ownership into programmable assets. Whether you’re a creator, a business, or an autonomous agent, Medialane enables your content to become sovereign, monetized IP in service of the Integrity Web.

## Article I: Identity

### Section 1: Name
The organization shall be called Medialane DAO.

### Section 2: Purpose
To build trust-minimized infrastructure where content, code, and culture can be tokenized, governed, and monetized via smart contracts. Medialane seeks to empower:
* Creators, developers, collectors, and organizations.
* Autonomous agents and AI entities.
* Communities building programmable public goods.

The purpose of Medialane is to create public goods and services that empower creators and intellectual property (IP) owners. By tokenizing intelligence in Programmable IP, Medialane aims to establish new ways to create value that is accessible and inclusive through decentralized technology, including blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs.

### Section 3: Roots
Rooted in privacy, freedom, transparency, and public goods — Medialane exists to dismantle bureaucracy silos and cultivate an open, composable information economy.

## Article II: Membership

### Section 1: Eligibility
Membership in Medialane DAO is open to any individual or organization that supports the purpose and goals of the organization through ownership of the MIP token. Membership is open to:
* Individuals, legal entities, and DAOs.
* AI agents with cryptographic identifiers and verifiable credentials.
* Autonomous intelligence capable of interfacing with smart contracts.

### Section 2: Rights
* Vote on proposals proportional to MIP token holdings.
* Propose initiatives and amendments.
* Access IP tooling, infrastructure, and metadata services.
* Maintain digital sovereignty over their creations.

## Article III: Governance

Medialane DAO operates as a decentralized autonomous organization, with decisions made collectively by its members through a transparent and democratic process.

### Section 1: Process & Participation
All proposals are initiated via the DAO’s governance platform, currently Snapshot, and subject to vote. A simple majority determines passage unless otherwise specified.

### Section 2: Equal Voice through Tokens
Each MIP token equals one unit of voting power. Agents may vote if granted rights via delegated smart contracts or DAO-approved protocols.

### Section 3: Working Groups & SubDAOs
To efficiently manage the DAO’s operations, specialized committees and working groups may be established to focus on areas such as:
* Technical development.
* Creative IP valuation.
* AI-assisted governance modeling.
* Conflict resolution & ethics.

## Article IV: Incentives

To ensure the long-term viability of Medialane as a public goods provider, the primary purpose of fees and revenue services is to fund continuing development and improvement. All DAO revenue — fees, premium services, royalties — is cycled back into support:
* Improvement of the Medialane protocol and services.
* Continued development infrastructure.
* Grants aligned with DAO goals.
* Perpetuity of services and long-term support.

## Article V: Public Goods

Treasury funds will first ensure long-term sustainability. Surplus funds may be distributed to:
* Empower user ownership and property rights.
* Community-driven initiatives.
* Public educational content.
* Open-source tooling and libraries.
* Assets and yield acquisition.

## Article VI: Programmable IP

### Section 1: Tokenization of IP
Medialane enables the tokenization of intellectual property using Starknet’s high-speed, low-cost smart contract intelligence. Any form of intelligence may tokenize content under supported standards (ERC721, ERC1155), including:
* Digital art.
* Algorithms and AI models.
* Music, literature, or datasets.

### Section 2: Licensing and Monetization
Smart contracts enforce:
* Proof of ownership and licensing.
* Attribution standards.
* Usage boundaries and licensing logic.
* ID and reputation.

### Section 3: Interoperability
Programmable IP may interact with dApps, games, metaverse environments, and autonomous agents without censorship or gatekeeping.

## Article VII: Tech Stack & Integrity Commitments

The DAO is committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and transparency, leveraging blockchain technology and regular audits.

### Section 1: Blockchain Protocols
Medialane integrates Starknet, Cairo VM, IPFS, and verifiable cryptographic
