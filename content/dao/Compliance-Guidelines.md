# Compliance Guidelines

These guidelines are designed to ensure integrity, compliance, and a commitment to the core values of decentralization and creator sovereignty. By participating in Medialane, you agree to adhere to these principles.

## 1. Introduction

Medialane is not a product—it’s infrastructure for humanity:

* Free to use, fork, and build on.
* Open-source and auditable.
* Designed for global accessibility.
* Committed to ethical innovation and decentralization.

## 2. Purpose & Scope

This resource hub equips Medialane users with the legal knowledge and tools needed to navigate:

* Global intellectual property (IP) protections.
* Blockchain and data compliance.
* DAO governance responsibilities.
* Licensing and monetization standards.
* Risk mitigation and dispute resolution.

*Note: These resources are educational and community-driven. Medialane does not provide legal advice or representation.*

## 3. Global IP Compliance

Medialane aligns with the Berne Convention (1886), covering 181 countries:

* **Automatic protection:** No registration required for authorship recognition.
* **Duration:** 50–70 years depending on jurisdiction.
* **Scope:** Literary, artistic, musical, and intellectual works.

**Creators are responsible for:**
* Ensuring originality and non-infringement.
* Defining licensing terms clearly.
* Using accurate metadata for ownership and usage rights.

*For enhanced protection, creators may optionally register their works with national IP offices or use timestamped blockchain records as supplementary evidence.*

## 4. Blockchain & Data

Medialane operates on Starknet and Ethereum using smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs. Key compliance features:

* **On-chain transparency:** All IP registrations and licenses are public and immutable.
* **Metadata:** Stored on IPFS (decentralized storage).
* **Privacy:** No personal data is required for core protocol use.
* **Zero-knowledge proofs:** Verify information without revealing underlying data.

**Users should be aware of:**
* Jurisdictional differences in crypto regulation.
* Risks of pseudonymous interactions.
* Limitations of blockchain immutability.

## 5. Governance & Responsibility

Medialane is governed by a DAO. While decentralized, participants may face legal scrutiny in some jurisdictions:

* Contributors must comply with local laws and regulations.
* Proposal authors may be viewed as initiators of protocol changes.
* DAO members are responsible for their actions and decisions.
* Disputes should be resolved through community discussion and on-chain voting.

**To mitigate risk:**
* Operate transparently and document decisions.
* Avoid centralized control or collusion.
* Consider legal wrappers or jurisdictional guidance.

## 6. Regulatory Awareness

Medialane does not require KYC or AML procedures for core protocol use. However:

* Third-party integrations (e.g., marketplaces, social login) may impose compliance requirements.
* DAO treasury operations should avoid exposure to sanctioned entities or illicit flows.
* Contributors should stay informed about evolving crypto regulations in their region.

## 7. Dispute Resolution

Medialane does not mediate disputes. Creators may pursue enforcement through:

* **Proof of Ownership:** On-chain evidence (e.g., timestamped IP registration).
* **Off-chain legal channels:** Such as DMCA takedowns or copyright claims.

## 8. Risk Management & Best Practices

To protect your intellectual property and contributions:

* Use secure wallets and do not share your private keys/passwords.
* Document decisions and agreements.
* Stay informed about international IP and regulations.
