# Governance Charter

Medialane DAO exists to unlock intellectual property for the Integrity Web. Our governance framework ensures that creators, contributors, and communities can collaborate transparently, equitably, and autonomously.

## 1. Introduction

This Charter defines how decisions are made, responsibilities are shared, and the protocol evolves—guided by the principles of decentralization, creator sovereignty, and long-term sustainability.

## 2. Core Principles

We are governed by values that reflect our commitment to a fair and open digital future:

* **Decentralization:** Decisions are made collectively.
* **Transparency:** Governance actions are recorded on-chain.
* **Sovereignty:** Creators retain full control over their IP and participation.
* **Inclusivity:** Participation is open to all users.
* **Integrity:** We uphold ethical standards in all protocol and community actions.

## 3. Participation

Anyone with a compatible wallet may participate in Medialane DAO. No KYC or registration is required. Members may:

* Submit proposals and vote on governance decisions.
* Join working groups and community initiatives.
* Contribute to protocol development, education, and business development.

## 4. Governance Tokens

Governance tokens may be used to:

* Propose changes to the protocol or governance structure.
* Vote on proposals, protocol upgrades, and business decisions.
* Participate in working groups and community initiatives.
* Access contributor rewards and reputation systems.

*Token distribution and voting mechanisms are defined by smart contracts and may evolve through DAO consensus.*

## 5. Proposal Lifecycle

Decisions follow a transparent, structured process:

* **Submission:** Any member may submit a proposal using the DAO template.
* **Discussion:** Community feedback is gathered via communication channels.
* **Voting:** Proposals are voted on using governance tokens or delegated voting.
* **Execution:** Approved proposals are implemented via smart contracts or working groups.

*Minimum quorum and majority thresholds are enforced by protocol logic.*

## 6. Governance Domains

The DAO governs key areas of the Medialane ecosystem:

* **Protocol Upgrades:** Smart contract changes and feature enhancements.
* **Treasury Management:** Grants, bounties, and ecosystem funding.
* **Business Development:** Operations to build clients and commercial partnerships.
* **Community Initiatives:** Events, education, and outreach programs.
* **Support:** User and business LTS support, bug fixes, products, and services.

## 7. Working Groups

To scale governance and empower contributors, the DAO may delegate responsibilities to specialized teams (e.g., Business, Development, Creator Relations, Marketing and Communications). Each working group operates transparently and reports to the DAO.

## 8. Treasury & Funding

The DAO treasury is managed via smart contracts or multisig wallets:

* Funds are allocated through approved proposals.
* All transactions are publicly auditable.
* Treasury inflows may include service fees, donations, or royalties.

## 9. Conflict Resolution

Disputes are resolved through:

* Open discussion and mediation.
* Proposal-based arbitration mechanisms.
* Optional integration with decentralized dispute resolution protocols.

## 10. Amendments & Evolution

This Charter may be amended through DAO proposals:

* Changes require quorum and supermajority approval.
* Decisions and updates are recorded on-chain for transparency.
* The DAO may evolve its structure through progressive decentralization.
