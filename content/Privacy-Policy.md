# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use Medialane.

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Medialane, a permissionless intellectual property provider built on Starknet. This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled across our decentralized ecosystem, in alignment with our commitment to user sovereignty, transparency, and compliance with international IP standards.

## 2. Data Philosophy

Medialane is designed to operate with minimal data collection:

* **Privacy by Design:** No personal identifiers are required to access core features.
* **Decentralized Identity:** No centralized accounts, passwords, or KYC processes.
* **Minimal Data Collection:** No default cookies, trackers, or behavioral analytics.

*We believe privacy is a right—not a feature.*

## 3. Voluntary Data Disclosure

Users may choose to share limited data when engaging with optional services:

* Wallet addresses for DAO participation or licensing agreements.
* IP metadata (e.g., title, description, licensing terms).
* DAO governance inputs, such as votes or proposals.
* Transaction data for royalty distribution or IP management.
* User-generated content (e.g., interactions, reviews) in social media.

## 4. Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information:

* **Encryption:** Data encrypted in transit and at rest.
* **Security Audits:** Regular security audits and assessments.
* **Access Controls:** Strict access controls and authentication.
* **Secure Integration:** Secure blockchain integration protocols.

## 5. Blockchain Transparency

Starknet leverages STARK proofs and the Cairo VM to process transactions off-chain, then submits them to Ethereum for final settlement:

* Tokenized IP assets, licensing contracts, and ownership proofs are public.
* Zero-knowledge proofs may be used to preserve confidentiality while ensuring verifiability.
* Medialane cannot modify or delete blockchain records.

## 6. Licensing & Ownership Records

Through smart contract integrations, users can:

* Create and sign IP licensing agreements permissionlessly.
* Generate Proof of Ownership and Proof of Licensing records.
* Store metadata publicly for transparency and legal recognition.
* Records are timestamped, immutable, and accessible via the dApp interface.

## 7. Cookies and Tracking

We avoid cookies and similar technologies to protect your privacy on the dApp. For detailed information, please see our Cookie Policy.

## 8. Third-Party Ecosystem Interactions

Medialane may interface with external platforms (e.g., games, marketplaces, AI agents):

* These integrations are opt-in and operate independently.
* Users are responsible for reviewing third-party privacy policies.
* Medialane does not share or sell user data to third parties.

## 9. DAO Governance & Public Participation

Medialane is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO):

* All proposals, votes, and governance actions are recorded on-chain.
* Participation is pseudonymous and open to any wallet holder.
* No centralized moderation or surveillance is conducted.

## 10. Security & Sovereignty

We prioritize cryptographic security and user control:

* No custodial access to assets or identity.
* Smart contracts enforce permissions and asset integrity.
* Users retain full control over their IP, wallet, and licensing terms.

## 11. Legal Framework

Medialane aligns with the Berne Convention (1886):

* Tokenized IP assets are recognized in 181 countries as proof of authorship.
* Ownership validity spans 50 to 70 years, depending on jurisdiction.
* Medialane does not offer legal advice or representation.

## 12. Privacy Policy Updates

As a decentralized protocol, updates to this Privacy Policy may be proposed and ratified by the DAO with community consensus.
